// Unsafe:
// 
// Characters can be unsafe for a number of reasons.The space
// character is unsafe because significant spaces may disappearand
// insignificant spaces may be introduced when URLs are transcribed or
// typeset or subjected to the treatment of word - processing programs.
// The characters "<" and ">" are unsafe because they are used as the
// delimiters around URLs in free text; the quote mark(""") is used to
//     delimit URLs in some systems.The character "#" is unsafe and should
//     always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and in other
//     systems to delimit a URL from a fragment / anchor identifier that might
//     follow it.The character "%" is unsafe because it is used for
//     encodings of other characters.Other characters are unsafe because
//     gatewaysand other transport agents are known to sometimes modify
//     such characters.These characters are "{", "}", "|", "\", " ^ ", "~",
//     "[", "]", and "`".
// 
//     All unsafe characters must always be encoded within a URL.For
//     example, the character "#" must be encoded within URLs even in
//     systems that do not normally deal with fragment or anchor
//     identifiers, so that if the URL is copied into another system that
//     does use them, it will not be necessary to change the URL encoding.
//
// Reserved:
//
// Many URL schemes reserve certain characters for a special meaning :
// their appearance in the scheme - specific part of the URL has a
// designated semantics.If the character corresponding to an octet is
// reserved in a scheme, the octet must be encoded.The characters ";",
// "/", "?", ":", "@", "=" and "&" are the characters which may be
// reserved for special meaning within a scheme.No other characters may
// be reserved within a scheme.
//
// Usually a URL has the same interpretation when an octet is
// represented by a characterand when it encoded.However, this is not
// true for reserved characters : encoding a character reserved for a
// particular scheme may change the semantics of a URL.
// 
// Thus, only alphanumerics, the special characters "$-_.+!*'(),", and
// reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used
// unencoded within a URL.
// 
// On the other hand, characters that are not required to be encoded
// (including alphanumerics) may be encoded within the scheme - specific
// part of a URL, as long as they are not being used for a reserved
// purpose.
